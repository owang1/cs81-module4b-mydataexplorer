Yes, my predictions were all correct. I was surprised to see that coffee was only somewhat correlated with focus. The correlation functions were definitely the hardest to code, but it was good that it was the last part. It helped to break up the logic into smaller functions for that. I don't regularly track data like my mood, but I used my real sleep data and screentime for this assignment. I don't actually drink much coffee so I used higher caffeine volumes than I actually consume to see more of a pattern. I think it was also a little hard to rate my fousLevel from 1-10 because I do different tasks and activities when I'm at work vs days off vs over the weekend. I tried to estimate it the best I could.
